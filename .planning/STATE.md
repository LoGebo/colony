## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Row-level multi-tenancy with community_id (CONFIRMED - get_current_community_id() RLS helper created)
- UUIDs for all PKs for offline-sync (CONFIRMED - generate_uuid_v7() function created)
- Soft deletes everywhere for audit/sync (CONFIRMED - soft_delete() and perform_soft_delete() created)
- NUMERIC(15,4) for financial amounts (CONFIRMED - money_amount domain created)
- Spanish unit types for Mexican market (casa, departamento, etc.)
- ON DELETE RESTRICT for communities.organization_id to prevent orphan communities
- Denormalized unit_count/resident_count on communities for dashboard performance
- RLS policies use (SELECT func()) pattern for JWT caching performance
- Coefficient NUMERIC(7,4) allows 4 decimal precision for Mexican indiviso percentages
- Units use ON DELETE RESTRICT from communities to prevent orphan data
- Residents 1:1 link to auth.users via id (PK is FK with ON DELETE CASCADE)
- Mexican name format: first_name, paternal_surname, maternal_surname with generated full_name
- Occupancies allow same resident multiple roles in same unit via unique(unit_id, resident_id, occupancy_type)
- Plate normalization via GENERATED ALWAYS column for LPR matching
- Pet vaccinations in separate table for time-series queries and expiry tracking
- 10MB file limit for resident documents (sufficient for ID scans and contracts)
- Partial unique index allows document re-upload after rejection
- Storage path convention: {community_id}/{resident_id}/{document_type}/{filename}
- Guards separate from residents to support third-party security companies
- Generated crosses_midnight column for automatic night shift detection
- Shift assignments use NULL effective_until for ongoing/indefinite assignments
- Polymorphic invitations with CHECK constraints enforce type-specific fields
- access_logs is append-only with trigger-enforced immutability (no deleted_at/updated_at)
- Hash chain column for tamper detection in access_logs
- Blacklist supports deny_entry, alert_only, call_police protocols

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: Phase 4 (Financial) needs deeper research on double-entry patterns for property management
- Research flag: Phase 5 (Amenities) needs exclusion constraint performance testing with RLS

## Session Continuity

## Next Steps

**Recommended:** Execute 03-03-PLAN.md (Patrol & Emergency)
