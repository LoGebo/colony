# Roadmap: UPOE Database Architecture

## Overview

This roadmap delivers the complete Supabase database schema for UPOE (Unified Property Operations Ecosystem) across 8 phases. Starting with multi-tenant foundation and RLS security, we build through identity, access control, financials, community features, and operational systems. Each phase creates tables, types, RLS policies, and indexes that subsequent phases depend on. The 147 requirements across 24 domains map to natural delivery boundaries where each phase delivers a coherent, testable capability.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.
